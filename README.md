<b><i> A linear regression model of the NO2 and CO levels in Argentina</i></b>

Using three different kinds of models for linear regression using Bayesian Inference. The variables of interest here were CO and NO2 levels in Argentina. I used
linear regression to create a model that can predict NO2 levels given observed CO levels in the air
